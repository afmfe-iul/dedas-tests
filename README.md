dedas-tests
===========

## Title One

This is the base test.

This command has a special argument called `dedas`


## Title Two

That would be another edit by Pierre.

This command accepts one parameter of type `pierre`, that is way stupider compared to the `dedas` param.


### Title Three

This is an edit by Someoneelse.

This command only runs on `windows`, because it contains bugs, and windows users love bugs.


# Title Four

This is an edit by Andre.

Even if it doesn't make any sense, having this command is critical.
